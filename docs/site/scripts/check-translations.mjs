// Holds a translated README to the one it was translated from.
//
// A translation goes stale in a way review does not catch: the English page
// gains a flag, the Japanese page keeps the old command, and both files read
// correctly on their own. The prose is a human judgment and stays one. The
// parts that are not prose are not -- a command, a flag, a schema, a block of
// expected output are the same bytes in every language, and a difference there
// is a defect rather than a translation choice.
//
// So this gate compares the fenced blocks, requires the two files to link to
// each other, and holds the product name to the convention the translation
// declares: the reading is given once, at the first mention, and the Latin
// spelling is used everywhere after it.
//
// What it does NOT check is the prose. Nothing here can tell a good translation
// from a bad one, and pretending otherwise would be the worse failure: a gate
// that reports on the half it cannot read teaches a reader to trust it about
// the half it can.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-translations.mjs [--selftest]
//
// No npm dependencies: it reads two files and asks git which ones they are.
//
// stokaro/ptah carries the same gate over its own README, where it also states
// how the runnable example is covered. These are separate repositories with
// separate checkouts, so this is a second copy rather than a shared module, and
// a rule changed in one is changed in the other by hand.
